<p><strong>写一些废话在前面</strong>：</p>
<p>好久没有写博客了，也很久没有更新个人博客。之前这个站点的内容已经找不到了（大多数是关于深度学习和目标检测的，还有本科做的一些Toy-Project），索性从头配置，把之前的内容全部删除掉了，也算是一个新的开始。</p>
<p>这个博客主题是<strong>ICARUS赛博朋克版本</strong>，决定以后一直用下去了。我笔记本的桌面也是一张赛博朋克风的图，用了很久。最初选择计算机专业，是因为高中时在Coursera自学过前端的课程，当时觉得好有趣，而且我从小就喜欢打游戏;)。后来接触AI，心中便种下了一颗赛博朋克梦，又回到了Coursera，从吴恩达老师的经典《Deep Learning》学起，时常觉得和CS这个学科在冥冥之中有着不解之缘。</p>
<p>虽然大学四年在学业上取得了不错的成绩（刚入学的我数学垫底，及格都会眉飞色舞的开心好一阵，到最后专业第三，还保研到了复旦），可CS毕竟是一门实践学科，四年光阴拿去卷成绩、参加社团活动、各地旅行、认识有趣的人，也算是过的快乐且丰富多彩，但技术上的长进确实不多，背负科班的名号还是有些惭愧的，而成为技术大牛需要夜以继日的持续努力和实践。</p>
<p>22岁，读了研究生，开始认真思考未来的职业规划。</p>
<ul>
<li>是做一些<em>开源项目</em>，<em>背八股刷leetcode</em>，去面试前端后端？（虽然业务场景广泛，绩效清晰，但前端容易被替代，后端技术繁琐，还是要看业务线，以及需求来做事，最终成为螺丝钉，在国内还有裁员风险。）</li>
<li>是赶快<em>水两篇文章</em>，背八股文刷leetcode，去面试算法工程师？（虽然和研究方向沾边，但已经卷成麻花，且没有什么好的业务能落地，移动互联网红利期结束，AI不再像过去一样能圈很多钱，面向落地和前后端没区别，面向算法的炼丹师能让人焦虑的要死，一个月没什么指标提升就可以考虑如何体面的离职了）</li>
<li>是<em>疯狂水文章，读博士</em>，然后再去工业界&#x2F;学术界呢？</li>
<li>是在国内卷，还是<em>润</em>出去呢？</li>
<li>是直接躺平去央企国企银行，考公务员呢？还是继续在大厂卷技术产品经理？</li>
<li>……</li>
</ul>
<p>你看，成长最讨厌的，就是把我们变成现实、唯结果论、喜欢分析利弊的大人。在这个极度内卷的时代，这是生存下去的必要品质，但上述所提到的也不过是一些同质化竞争。我们焦虑，我们张口闭口提八股文leetcode、CCF-A论文×N、50w的package、大厂实习和转正，好像这些是衡量人生成功与否唯一的标志，早就把<strong>热爱</strong>二字抛到九霄云外了，这里的热爱可不是“为的就是这块技术“，现实主义和理想主义从来都不是二选一问题。人变老的标志不是年龄的增长，而是现实消磨掉了你原本拥有的理想主义。</p>
<p>最后再引两段我很喜欢的话，作为过去的结束语，以及未来的开场白：</p>
<p>“那一天我二十一岁，在我一生的黄金时代。我有好多奢望。我想爱，想吃，还想在一瞬间变成天上半明半暗的云。后来我才知道，生活就是个缓慢受锤的过程，人一天天老下去，奢望也一天天消失，最后变得像挨了锤的牛一样。可是我过二十一岁生日时没有预见到这一点。<strong>我觉得自己会永远生猛下去，什么也锤不了我。</strong>“</p>
<p>“回头看他人生的故事的时候，我们或许觉得传奇精彩，可是带入来看却会发现他在面临每一个人生岔路口时，做出的每一个决定需要付出多大的勇气。<strong>都说人生任何时候开始都不晚，或许前提是那个人背负着巨大的足以支撑其走到最后的信念和梦想。毕竟人生区区百年，只争朝夕。</strong>“</p>

<p>更新想法。</p>
<p>任何技术（前端&#x2F;后端&#x2F;算法&#x2F;数据库&#x2F;网安&#x2F;操作系统）都可以深挖，都需要持续不断的学习，才不会被日新月异的技术洪流淘汰掉。找到自己感兴趣的就好。</p>
<p>以及，</p>
<p>Try first. 任何新鲜事物都先试试看。</p>
<p><strong>大凡事物必有顺序。</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>看得太超前了不行，看得太超前，势必忽视脚下，人往往跌倒。</strong></li>
<li><strong>可另一方面，光看脚下也不行，不知道前面你会撞上什么。</strong></li>
<li><strong>所以，要在适度往前看的同时，按部就班处理眼下事物。这点至为关键，无论做什么。</strong></li>

<p>更新想法。</p>
<p>昨天晚上的飞机，终于回到了上海。</p>
<p>今天收拾了一下行李，晚上骑着我的可爱电瓶车就来实验室了（感觉车好像坏掉了，明天一定要记得去修啊！），呆在实验室心情开心的爆表了！我真是骨子里的工作狂…（也不是啦，天天在家躺着就觉得好丧，如果不做些自己觉得有意义的事情，就会觉得出去玩也不快乐…）</p>
<p>昨晚躺床上，和舍友聊职业规划、未来blahblah的。</p>
<p>舍友：chatgpt出来，还是觉得后端更容易被代替（因为我说前端更容易被替代），虽然也有难的技术部分（比如处理高并发场景，还有许多涉及复杂算法的场景），但大多数情况下，日常工作中就是增删改查crud。前端可能会好点，因为需要人觉得美观，而且科班出来一般都是做后端，竞争更激烈。（but我觉得前端就是拿产品+设计给的图，照着敲罢了…因为之前试着做过一段前端的工作，其实美观不美观是设计需要处理的，设计没准在不远的将来也会被代替了，更别说前端了。）</p>
<p>舍友：居然是nlp先出现了这种模型，那cv呢？（我：我觉得可能cv要做这种多任务大预训练太费算力了。。所以目前没有人那么有钱敢这么做的哈哈哈哈。不过我估计<strong>未来都是大模型的天下（算力、数据方面）</strong>了。要么就是<strong>等一个真正的底层颠覆性的DL算法创新（算法方面）</strong>）</p>
<p>最后我俩总结，【如果想搞钱的话】（这是前提，今天刷到一句话，”Ta聊起研究方向时能够滔滔不绝，Ta眼里闪闪发光，说读博的目的是为了尝试突破某个方向的科研桎梏“。我想，这才是一个真正的博士该有的品质吧，也蛮像我自己理想中的生活的。其实感觉自己还是蛮有科研激情的，不过自己的性格是真的坐不住静不下来）</p>
<ul>
<li><p>前后端等等容易被代替（聊了一下chatgpt、以及微软和openai合作的GitHub Copilot辅助写代码很好用）。pass掉做软件产品、工程向。</p>
</li>
<li><p>算法研究岗要读个博士，预计未来DL都是大模型的天下，高校也没有算力支撑做这些事情，除非和企业合作。pass掉工业&#x2F;学术界科研向。</p>
</li>
<li><p>硕士出去肯定做不了research。算法工程落地写python c++，处理数据。勉强能冲着看。但要是炼丹提指标是kpi，那可能也不是很友好。</p>
</li>
<li><p>搞一搞AI+金融（我俩对金融都有点兴趣），找个类似私募的单位做点东西。我觉得这条路还挺有意思的。但是转纯金融是不可能的，马太效应最明显的一个行业。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>最简单的还是去找一些工作几年了的前辈聊一聊，感觉会少走很多的弯路。而且我觉得写代码只是程序员、研究员工作中最基础的一个环节，其实也没必要过于悲观。而且<strong>从商业角度看，软件技术，主要靠一个商业模式，要有一个好的故事，要有用户肯买账才行</strong>。</p>
<p>今天又是没想清楚未来该何去何从的一天呢！</p>
<p>不过能够肯定的是，以后一定要做<strong>计算机&#x2F;金融</strong>这俩方向的。</p>
<p>先把手头的事情做好，船到桥头自然直~</p>

<h1 id="Speech"><a href="#Speech" class="headerlink" title="Speech"></a>Speech</h1><p>You’ve got to find what you love.</p>
<p>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
<h2 id="The-first-story-is-about-connecting-the-dots"><a href="#The-first-story-is-about-connecting-the-dots" class="headerlink" title="The first story is about connecting the dots."></a>The first story is about connecting the dots.</h2><p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?</p>
<p>It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.</p>
<p>And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</p>
<p>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p>
<p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.</p>
<p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever, because believing that the dots that will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.</p>
<h2 id="My-second-story-is-about-love-and-loss"><a href="#My-second-story-is-about-love-and-loss" class="headerlink" title="My second story is about love and loss."></a>My second story is about love and loss.</h2><p>I was lucky – I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p>
<p>I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me – I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>
<p>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</p>
<p>During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I retuned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.</p>
<h2 id="My-third-story-is-about-death"><a href="#My-third-story-is-about-death" class="headerlink" title="My third story is about death."></a>My third story is about death.</h2><p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
<p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
<p>About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</p>
<p>I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form. of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.</p>
<p>This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:</p>
<p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p>
<p>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960’s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
<p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</p>

My research focuses on computer vision👁️, especially image/face inpainting and image quality assessment. 💻I graduated from Tianjin University with a Bachelor&#039;s degree in Software Engineering, and acquired a little knowledge about 2d/3d object detection. I worked as an algorithm engineer intern at CATRC and Baidu. 📙I enjoy reading (especially psychology and philosophy), traveling🧳, photography📸, working out💪, and dancing💃 in my free time. 🚀I want to become an algorithm engineer or go to the U.S. for Ph.D. 3 years later.</p><p class="is-size-6 is-flex justify-content-center"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt
